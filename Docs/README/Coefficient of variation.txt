# The coefficient of variation analysis must be performed using the normalized intensity/abundance values.
# The calculations must be performed in Excel.

Step 1. Calculate the mean of the normalized intensities for the experimental group using the equation:
=AVERAGE(A1:A3)

Step 2. Calculate the standard deviation of the normalized intensities for the experimental group using the equation:
=STDEV(A1:A3)

Step 3. Calculate the coefficient of variation using the formula:
=(STDEV/AVERAGE)*100

Step 4. In a new spreadsheet, add the name of the experimental group in the first cell of the column and then add the coefficient of variation values.
