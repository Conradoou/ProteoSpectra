# Only for proteins

In the Excel file heatmap_example, the Accession column represents the Uniprot code of the proteins, followed by the normalized intensities.

Step 1: Calculate the average of the normalized intensities for the control group using the formula:
=Mean(A1:A3)

Step 2: In the heatmap_example file, the cells in orange represent the calculation required for the graph. Use the formula:
=-LOG(control average / replicate intensity, 2)
This will give a scale from -2 to 2.

Step 3: Copy the results of the -Log2 values and paste them into a new Excel sheet under the corresponding code.
